epoxy isn't just for reports and Shiny apps!
You can use the `epoxy()` function just like an `epoxy` knitr chunk.

```{r}
movie <- list(
	year = 1989,
	title = "Back to the Future Part II",
	budget = 4e+07
)

epoxy(
	"The movie {.titlecase movie$title}",
	"was released in {movie$year}",
	"and was filmed with a budget of",
	"{.dollar movie$budget}.",
	.sep = "\n"
)
```

For HTML and LaTeX contexts, check out `epoxy_html()` and `epoxy_latex()`.
These work just like `epoxy()`,
but use convenient defaults for HTML and LaTeX settings.
