## Templating in Shiny

[Shiny apps][shiny] are a great way to design interactive web applications,
and epoxy includes several functions
to help you weave reactive data into your apps.

Here are some ways you can use epoxy in your Shiny apps:

1. Make the text portion of any element in your Shiny UI update dynamically.

2. Weave reactive text into prose in your app.

3. Build powerful templates using the [mustache templating language][mustache].


Shiny already includes two reactive text outputs:

* `shiny::uiOutput()` (a.k.a. `shiny::htmlOutput()`) and
* `shiny::textOutput()`.

These are great for displaying reactive text in your app,
but they have some limitations:

* `uiOutput()` tends to move your UI logic into the `server` function,
  making it harder to know the final structure of your UI.

* `textOutput()` is great for displaying reactive text,
  but often requires messing with the `.noWS` argument
  to get the spacing around the dynamic text _just right_.

In this article, we'll learn how to use epoxy in Shiny apps
and see that it can help us overcome these limitations.

## Introducing epoxy in Shiny

### A basic Shiny app with `textOutput()`

Let's start with an example Shiny app.
It's a simple but friendly app that greets the user by name.

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(shiny)

ui <- fluidPage(
  textInput("name", "What's your name?"),
  p("Hello,", textOutput("greeting", inline = TRUE), "!")
)

server <- function(input, output) {
  output$greeting <- renderText(input$name)
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

This gets you pretty close,
but you have to remember to include `inline = TRUE` in `textOutput()`
and there's some extra space
between the user's name and the exclamation point
that you'd probably like to get rid of[^container-arg].

[^container-arg]: To fix the spacing between `textOutput()` and it's syblings, you'd have to use the `container` argument of `textOutput()` to give it a custom container function that includes the `.noWS` argument, such as `container = function(x) span(x, .noWS = "after")`.

### Setting up `ui_epoxy_html()`

With `ui_epoxy_html()`, this is easy to fix:

1. Wrap a portion of your UI in `ui_epoxy_html()` and give it an `.id`.

1. Use `{{ name }}` syntax to define fields where the dynamic text should go.

1. In your server code, assign `render_epoxy()` to an output matching the UI's
   `.id` and pass in the reactive data as arguments with names matching the
   dynamic fields.

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(shiny)
library(epoxy)

ui <- fluidPage(
  textInput("name", "What's your name?"),
  ui_epoxy_html(
    .id = "greeting",
    p("Hello, {{name}}!")
  )
)

server <- function(input, output) {
  output$greeting <- render_epoxy(
    name = input$name
  )
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

### Default or error values

Another advantage of using `ui_epoxy_html()` over `textOutput()`
is that you can set default values that appear immediately
before the server responds
or that are used when an error occurs.
In the next app,
`name` is set to `"friend"` by default in `ui_epoxy_html()`,
and on the server side I've also added a `validate()` call
indicating that we need a name with at least 2 characters.

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(shiny)
library(epoxy)

ui <- fluidPage(
  textInput("name", "What's your name?"),
  ui_epoxy_html(
    .id = "greeting",
    p("Hello, {{name}}!"),
    name = "friend"
  )
)

server <- function(input, output) {
  name <- reactive({
    validate(need(
      nchar(input$name) > 2,
      "Name must be more than 2 characters."
    ))
    input$name
  })

  output$greeting <- render_epoxy(
    name = name()
  )
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

If the user hasn't yet entered a name of more than 2 characters,
the text for the `name` field will use the default value
and will have a red squiggle below it.
If they hover over the squiggle,
the error message is shown in the hover text.

### A few more things about `ui_epoxy_html()`

* can re-use `{{ name }}` in several places
* can use `{{ name }}` anywhere that you could put a `<span>`
* can use `{{ <markup> <expr> }}` syntax from `epoxy_html()`
  (but not inline transformations)
* bare character strings are assumed to be HTML,
  replacement is not unless you use `{{{ name }}}`
* sends html, can't send html with new dependencies

### Connecting epoxy with a reactive data frame

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(shiny)
library(epoxy)

movie_choices <- bechdel$imdb_id
names(movie_choices) <- bechdel$title

ui <- fixedPage(
  selectInput("movie", "Pick a movie", choices = movie_choices),
  ui_epoxy_html(
    .id = "movie_info",
    p(
      "{{ em title }} was released in {{ strong year }}.",
      "It was directed by {{ director }} and rated {{ rated }}."
    )
  )
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  movie <- reactive({
    bechdel[bechdel$imdb_id == input$movie, ]
  })

  output$movie_info <- render_epoxy(.list = movie())
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```
