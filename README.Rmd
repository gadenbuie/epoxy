## epoxy in R Markdown and Quarto documents

In [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) and
[Quarto](https://quarto.org) documents,
**epoxy** gives you an `epoxy` chunk where you can write in markdown,
blending prose and data using [glue]'s template syntax.

```{r child = "man/fragments/example-movie.Rmd"}
```
