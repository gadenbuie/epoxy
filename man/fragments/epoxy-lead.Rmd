epoxy makes it easy to use [glue] in scripts, reports, and apps.
:::

## epoxy is super-strength glue

* In [R Markdown][rmarkdown] and [Quarto][quarto] reports, use `epoxy` chunks
  for super-strength inline syntax. Just call `library(epoxy)` or use
	`use_epoxy_knitr_engines()` to get started.

* In R scripts, the same functions that power epoxy chunks are availble in
  three flavors:

  * `epoxy()` for markdown and general purpose outputs

  * `epoxy_html()` for HTML outputs, with added support for HTML templating
		(see `?epoxy_transform_html`).

  * `epoxy_latex()` for LaTeX reports

  These functions are accompanied by a robust system for chained
	glue-transformers powered by `epoxy_transform()`.

* In [Shiny apps][shiny], `ui_epoxy_html()` make it easy to update text or HTML
  dynamically anywhere in your app. For even more complicated situations,
	`ui_epoxy_mustache()` lets you turn any Shiny UI into a template that
	leverages the [Mustache templating language][mustache].
