## epoxy is super glue

### [In R Markdown and Quarto reports][epoxy-report]

Use `epoxy` chunks for extra-strength inline syntax.
Just `library(epoxy)`
in your [R Markdown][rmarkdown] or [Quarto][quarto]
document to get started.
All epoxy chunks make it easy to transform values in place
with a `{cli}`-inspired inline syntax
described in `?epoxy_transform_inline`.

### [In R scripts][epoxy-script]

The same functions that power epoxy chunks are availble in three flavors:

* `epoxy()` for markdown and general purpose outputs

* `epoxy_html()` for HTML outputs, with added support for HTML templating
	(see `?epoxy_transform_html`)

* `epoxy_latex()` for LaTeX reports

These functions are accompanied by
a robust system for chained glue-transformers
powered by `epoxy_transform()`.

### [In Shiny apps][epoxy-shiny]

`ui_epoxy_html()` makes it easy to update text or HTML dynamically,
anywhere in your [Shiny][shiny] app's UI.
For more complicated situations,
`ui_epoxy_mustache()` lets you turn any Shiny UI
into a template that leverages the [Mustache templating language][mustache].
