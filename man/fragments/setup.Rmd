```{r library-epoxy}
library(epoxy)
```

Loading epoxy adds four new knitr engines, or chunk types.
Each type lets you intermix text with R code or data,
and each is geared toward a different output context:

* `epoxy` is an all-purpose glue chunk and uses `{ }` for delimiters
* `epoxy_html` is a glue chunk for HTML and uses `{{ }}` for delimiters
* `epoxy_latex` is a glue chunk for LaTeX and uses `< >` for delimiters
* `whisker` is an all-purpose chunk for the [mustache template language][whisker]

⚠️ **Caution:** Previously, epoxy provided a `glue` chunk,
but this clashes with a chunk engine provided by the [glue] package.
If you wish to restore use epoxy's `glue` chunk,
you can include the following in your setup chunk.

```r
use_epoxy_glue_engine()
```
