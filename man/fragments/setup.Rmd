```{r library-epoxy}
library(epoxy)
```

Loading epoxy adds four new [knitr engines][knitr-engines], or chunk types.
Each type lets you intermix text with R code or data (`expr` in the table below),
and each is geared toward a different output context.

| Engine        | Output Context       |               Delimiter               |
| :------------ | :------------------- | :-----------------------------------: |
| `epoxy`       | all-purpose markdown |               `{expr}`                |
| `epoxy_html`  | HTML                 |              `{{expr}}`               |
| `epoxy_latex` | LaTeX                |              `<<expr>>`               |
| `whisker`     | all-purpose          | [mustache template language][whisker] |

⚠️ **Caution:** Previously, epoxy provided a `glue` engine,
but this conflicts with a similar chunk engine by the [glue] package.
You can update existing documents to use the `epoxy` engine,
or you can explicitly use epoxy's `glue` chunk
by including the following in your setup chunk.

```r
use_epoxy_glue_engine()
```
