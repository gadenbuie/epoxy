Here's an example using a small list containing data about a `movie`
(expand the section below to see the full code for `movie`).
We can use the inline transformer to format the replacement text
as we build up a description from this data.

<details><summary>Movie data</summary>

```{r}
movie <- list(
  year = 1989,
  title = "Back to the Future Part II",
  budget = 4e+07,
  domgross = 118450002,
  imdb_rating = 7.8,
  actors = c(
    "Michael J. Fox",
    "Christopher Lloyd",
    "Lea Thompson",
    "Thomas F. Wilson"
  ),
  runtime = 108L
)
```

</details>

````{verbatim}
```{epoxy}
The movie {.emph {.titlecase movie$title}}
was released in {.strong movie$year}.
It earned {.dollar movie$domgross}
with a budget of {.dollar movie$budget},
and it features movie stars
{.and movie$actors}.
