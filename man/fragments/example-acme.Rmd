Say you're writing a report and you've calculated revenue and expenses for your company:

````{verbatim}
```{r}
library(epoxy)

revenue <- 1000000
expenses <- 800000
```
````

With **epoxy** you can fold these values into your prose,
formatting them as you use the values.

````{verbatim}
```{epoxy}
Acme Corp. had a revenue of {.dollar revenue}
and expenses of {.dollar expenses},
resulting in a profit of {.dollar profit <- revenue - expenses}
and a gross margin of
{.pct profit / revenue}
```
````

The rendered output has the final values, formatted just right.

```{r echo = FALSE}
library(epoxy)

revenue <- 1000000
expenses <- 800000
```

<blockquote>
```{epoxy echo = FALSE}
Acme Corp. had a revenue of {.dollar revenue}
and expenses of {.dollar expenses},
resulting in a profit of {.dollar profit <- revenue - expenses}
and a gross margin of
{.pct profit / revenue}
```
</blockquote>
